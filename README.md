# AppDepot
Secure Portal framework supporting rapid application development, independant of language.

A secure portal type application provides four basic functions for a Web development team: application security, account management, user and application mapping, and modular application development capability. AppDepot is not a content management system. The main objective of AppDepot is to offload critical functionality from the application and onto AppDepot. Web application developers are then free to focus on core application functionality. AppDepot works to provide a lightweight, small footprint platform where users and applications meet securely.

AppDepot is written in PHP with a MySQL database backend.

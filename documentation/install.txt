AppDepot Installation

AppDepot can be downloaded from our website at http://appdepot.org or
http://sourceforge.net/projects/appdepot. Once downloaded, installing AppDepot
is a straightforward process. 

Simply unzip or untar the files into a web directory on
your server and browse to the root application folder to begin the installation
process. 

Prior to installation, you’ll need to have the following requirements met:

• The PHP user on your server must have read/write permissions to the
following files:
	o The entire install directory and all files inside
	o The includes/settings.php file
	o Whatever location you’ll specify as the log directory
• You must create a MySQL database and a user for App Depot to use
	o Be sure to give the user permissions to the database you create
	o App Depot will create all tables and installation data for you
• You’ll need at least one valid LDAP Authentication Source
	o This can be Active Directory, Open LDAP, or any other authentication
	source that uses the LDAP protocol
	o All App Depot users MUST have an account in a valid LDAP source in
	order to be added to App Depot
	o You’ll need to specify your first LDAP source during installation
• The PHP directive ‘register_globals’ MUST be turned OFF

The AppDepot installation program will verify that all these conditions are met
prior to proceeding with installation. If any of the above conditions are not met, you
will not be allowed to continue.

Follow the instructions on the installation page to continue and complete the
installation. At the bottom of the installation page is the ‘Verify Information’ button.
The installation will not complete until all the information you have given can be
verified as accurate and all the appropriate connections can be made. Once
verification is complete click ‘Complete Installation’ to finish the process.

Note: Changing any information after a successful verification will require all
information to be re-verified.

Once installation is complete, log in with the admin user you specified and begin using AppDepot!
